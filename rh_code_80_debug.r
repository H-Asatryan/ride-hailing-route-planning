# Because of unexpected errors, the compilation does not work!
# I have changed some data sets, but I think I have kept the
# column names etc, hence the file should work.

# After fixing I intend to add "Legend" using, e.g., the following template:

# trip_scenario_map = addLegend(
#   trip_scenario_map,
#   position = 'bottomleft',
#   colors = c("blue","gray"),
#   labels = palette(), opacity = 1,
#   title = 'An Obvious Legend'
# )

# Another option is the package ‘leaflegend’
